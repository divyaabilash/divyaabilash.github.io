            On Going Project: Frugal Innovation Lab: I am working on developing the Mobile app for the sparrow mobiles and Health 360. This app is developed to keep Reminders of Medical Appointments and Prescribed Medicals. The appointments and medicine reminder will be sent by the coordinator. Once the reminder is sent by coordinator, App gets the feed, and sets the reminder in the mobile of Homeless or Low income group. According to the time and date, the reminder is popped and reminds the person about the scheduled appointment or medical drug to be taken. Git link: https://github.com/divyaabilash/MyHealthApp
